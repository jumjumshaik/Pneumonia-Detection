**Dataset:** Kermany, Daniel; Zhang, Kang; Goldbaum, Michael (2018), “Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images for Classification”, Mendeley Data, V2, doi: 10.17632/rscbjbr9sj.2

In today's healthcare system, medical image analysis is essential for the diagnosis, management, and surveillance of a wide range of medical disorders. With an emphasis on the identification of pneumonia from chest X-ray pictures, our study aims to apply deep learning techniques—more particularly, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—to specific medical image analysis tasks.

**code Implementation**
* Data preprocessing and exploration.
* Construction of CNN models using Keras with TensorFlow backend.
* Model training and evaluation on training and test datasets.
* Analysis of model performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
